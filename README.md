## 🌟 What is Construct-OS?

Construct-OS is a revolutionary autonomous system that transforms construction business development from a manual, time-consuming process into a fully automated, AI-powered operation. It runs entirely on GitHub Actions, using workflows as its "operating system" and issues as its database.

### Key Features

- 🎯 **Autonomous Lead Discovery** - Scrapes and qualifies construction projects from multiple sources daily
- 📐 **AI-Powered Estimation** - Generates detailed cost estimates using machine learning and historical data
- 🗣️ **Automatic Proposal Generation** - Creates client-ready proposals with zero human input
- 🔧 **Self-Healing Architecture** - Automatically recovers from failures and maintains system health
- 🤖 **Genesis Auto-Merge** - Autonomous PR merging with squash (zero human approval needed)
- 🔄 **Recursive Self-Improvement** - Genesis Loop optimizes codebase every 6 hours
- 📊 **Real-Time Dashboard** - Monitor all operations from a centralized command center
- 💚 **Continuous Operation** - Runs 24/7 on CRON schedules and event triggers

## 🏛️ The Pentarchy Architecture

Construct-OS operates through five specialized autonomous agents:

| Agent | Role | Technology | Trigger |
|-------|------|------------|---------|
| 🎯 **Hunter** | Lead Discovery | Python + Playwright | Daily CRON |
| 📐 **Architect** | Cost Estimation | Python + AI/ML | New Lead Event |
| 🗣️ **Orator** | Proposal Generation | Python + GPT-4 | Estimate Complete |
| 🎛️ **Commander** | Orchestration Dashboard | Next.js | Continuous |
| 🏦 **Vault** | Knowledge Base | Python + Database | State Changes |

Each agent operates independently but communicates through GitHub's infrastructure (issues, comments, labels).

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- GitHub repository (this one!)
- GitHub Actions enabled
- API keys configured (OpenAI, etc.)

### Setup

1. **Configure Secrets** (Settings → Secrets → Actions):
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
   GITHUB_TOKEN=auto_provided
   ```

2. **Enable Workflows** (Actions tab):
   - Enable all workflows in `.github/workflows/`
   - Run Heartbeat workflow manually to verify setup

3. **Verify System Health**:
   - Check `data/active_memory.md` for system status
   - View GitHub Actions logs for agent activity

That's it! The system is now autonomous and will:
- Scrape for leads daily at 8:00 AM UTC
- Monitor health every 5 minutes
- Self-repair on any failures

### Daily Operations (No Human Required)

```
08:00 UTC → Hunter Agent runs
  ↓
  Discovers 50 projects → Qualifies 10 → Creates Issues
  ↓
  GitHub Webhook → Architect Agent triggered
  ↓
  Analyzes leads → Generates estimates → Posts comments
  ↓
  Estimate complete → Orator Agent triggered
  ↓
  Creates proposals → Uploads PDFs → Awaits client response
```

### Every 5 Minutes

```
Heartbeat runs → Checks system health → Updates active_memory.md
  ↓
  If failure detected → Self-Repair triggered → Auto-recovery
```

## 📊 Command Center Dashboard

Access real-time system metrics (when deployed):

- **Active Leads**: Live count of qualified opportunities
