## 🏛️ The Pentarchy Architecture

Five specialized autonomous agents:

| Agent | Function | Technology | Schedule |
|-------|----------|------------|----------|
| 🎯 **Hunter** | Lead Discovery | Python + Playwright | Daily @ 8 AM UTC |
| 📐 **Architect** | Cost Estimation | Python + AI/ML | On new leads |
| 🗣️ **Orator** | Proposal Gen | Python + GPT-4 | On estimates |
| 🎛️ **Commander** | Dashboard | Next.js + React | Continuous |
| 🏦 **Vault** | Knowledge Base | Python + DB | State changes |

Each agent operates **independently** and **autonomously**.
