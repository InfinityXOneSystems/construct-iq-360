## Corrective Actions Reference

### For a Developer Workstation (local sync)

```bash
# 1. Fetch all remote changes
git fetch origin --prune --tags

# 2. Check divergence
git status
git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD   # commits local has NOT on remote
git log --oneline HEAD..origin/main   # commits remote has NOT locally

# 3. Hard-reset to match remote (safest corrective action)
git checkout main
git reset --hard origin/main

# 4. Verify perfect sync
git diff origin/main HEAD   # should be empty
git status                  # should show clean
```

### For Remote (GitHub Actions / CI)

The `sync-validator.yml` workflow runs daily at 06:00 UTC and on every push to `main`.
Set input `corrective_action: auto-correct` on manual dispatch to auto-reset remote runners.
