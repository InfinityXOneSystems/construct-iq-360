## ğŸŒŸ What is Construct-OS?

Construct-OS is a revolutionary autonomous system that transforms construction business development from a manual, time-consuming process into a fully automated, AI-powered operation. It runs entirely on GitHub Actions, using workflows as its "operating system" and issues as its database.

### Key Features

- ğŸ¯ **Autonomous Lead Discovery** - Scrapes and qualifies construction projects from multiple sources daily
- ğŸ“ **AI-Powered Estimation** - Generates detailed cost estimates using machine learning and historical data
- ğŸ—£ï¸ **Automatic Proposal Generation** - Creates client-ready proposals with zero human input
- ğŸ”§ **Self-Healing Architecture** - Automatically recovers from failures and maintains system health
- ğŸ¤– **Genesis Auto-Merge** - Autonomous PR merging with squash (zero human approval needed)
- ğŸ”„ **Recursive Self-Improvement** - Genesis Loop optimizes codebase every 6 hours
- ğŸ“Š **Real-Time Dashboard** - Monitor all operations from a centralized command center
- ğŸ’š **Continuous Operation** - Runs 24/7 on CRON schedules and event triggers

## ğŸ›ï¸ The Pentarchy Architecture

Construct-OS operates through five specialized autonomous agents:

| Agent | Role | Technology | Trigger |
|-------|------|------------|---------|
| ğŸ¯ **Hunter** | Lead Discovery | Python + Playwright | Daily CRON |
| ğŸ“ **Architect** | Cost Estimation | Python + AI/ML | New Lead Event |
| ğŸ—£ï¸ **Orator** | Proposal Generation | Python + GPT-4 | Estimate Complete |
| ğŸ›ï¸ **Commander** | Orchestration Dashboard | Next.js | Continuous |
| ğŸ¦ **Vault** | Knowledge Base | Python + Database | State Changes |

Each agent operates independently but communicates through GitHub's infrastructure (issues, comments, labels).

## ğŸš€ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- GitHub repository (this one!)
- GitHub Actions enabled
- API keys configured (OpenAI, etc.)

### Setup

1. **Configure Secrets** (Settings â†’ Secrets â†’ Actions):
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
   GITHUB_TOKEN=auto_provided
   ```

2. **Enable Workflows** (Actions tab):
   - Enable all workflows in `.github/workflows/`
   - Run Heartbeat workflow manually to verify setup

3. **Verify System Health**:
   - Check `data/active_memory.md` for system status
   - View GitHub Actions logs for agent activity

That's it! The system is now autonomous and will:
- Scrape for leads daily at 8:00 AM UTC
- Monitor health every 5 minutes
- Self-repair on any failures
